Discussion O
In O
the O
present O
study O
, O
we O
show O
that O
Foxp3 GENE
functions O
as O
a O
potent O
repressor O
of O
NF O
- O
kappaB O
- O
and O
CREB O
- O
dependent O
transcriptional O
activation O
. O 

Furthermore O
, O
the O
carboxyl O
- O
terminal O
FKH O
domain O
appears O
to O
be O
dispensable O
for O
mediating O
these O
effects O
, O
at O
least O
in O
T O
cell O
populations O
. O 

This O
observation O
may O
become O
important O
in O
light O
of O
recent O
reports O
suggesting O
that O
Foxp3 GENE
expression O
in O
thymic O
epithelial O
cells O
was O
crucial O
for O
directing O
development O
of O
T O
cells O
in O
the O
thymus O
[ O
42 O
]. O
Interestingly O
, O
the O
majority O
of O
the O
genetic O
mutations O
associated O
with O
IPEX O
, O
a O
severe O
autoimmune O
disorder O
caused O
by O
functional O
inactivation O
of O
Foxp3 GENE
, O
map O
to O
the O
carboxyl O

terminal O
FKH O
domain O
or O
the O
leucine O
zipper O
domain O
in O
the O
central O
region O
of O
the O
protein O
. O 

Only O
one O
mutation O
associated O
with O
IPEX O
to O
date O
has O
been O
mapped O
to O
the O
amino O
- O
terminal O
proline O
- O
rich O
region O
[ O
43 O
]. O
It O
is O
possible O
that O
the O
FKH O
domain O
has O
a O
complex O
tertiary O
structure O
that O
is O
particularly O
sensitive O
to O
misfolding O
caused O
by O
genetic O
mutations O
and O
that O
an O
intact O
FKH O
domain O
is O
absolutely O
critical O
for O
promoting O
Foxp3 GENE
function O
in O
the O
nucleus O
, O
whereas O
the O
structure O
of O
the O
amino O
- O
terminal O
proline O
- O
rich O
region O
may O
tolerate O
certain O
mutations O
as O
long O
as O
the O
NF O
- O
kappaB O
/ O
NF O
- O
AT O
binding O
motif O
remains O
unaltered O
. O 

This O
motif O
may O
also O
include O
the O
zinc O
finger O
domain O
. O 

A O
logical O
region O
that O
may O
be O
targeted O
by O
the O
amino O
- O
terminal O
proline O
- O
rich O
region O
of O
Foxp3 GENE
is O
the O
Rel O
homology O
domain O
found O
in O
both O
NF O
- O
kappaB O
and O
NF O
- O
AT O
family O
proteins O
. O 

A O
region O
that O
may O
also O
be O
important O
with O
respect O
to O
Foxp3 GENE
function O
is O
the O
leucine O
zipper O
domain O
, O
as O
demonstrated O
by O
the O
number O
of O
mutations O
associated O
with O
IPEX O
that O
have O
been O
mapped O
in O
this O
region O
of O
Foxp3 GENE
. O 

The O
role O
of O
this O
domain O
in O
Foxp3 GENE
function O
remains O
uncharacterized O
, O
but O
may O
play O
a O
role O
in O
dimer O
formation O
as O
it O
does O
in O
other O
Foxp O
family O
members O
[ O

Transactivation O
of O
the O

by O
Tax GENE
involves O
the O
interaction O
of O
ATF O

We O

The O

utilizing O

Importantly O
, O
we O
demonstrated O
that O

Previous O
studies O
have O
demonstrated O
that O

These O

the O

Therefore O
, O
Foxp3 GENE

an O

the O
development O

the O

in O

also O
be O
down O

I O
Tax GENE
[ O

As O
the O
activation O
of O
the O
HTLV O

LTR O
depends O
primarily O
on O
ATF O

CREB O
proteins O
( O
whether O
in O
the O

we O
investigated O
whether O
Foxp3 GENE

interact O
with O
this O
additional O
cellular O

While O
the O
DNA O

CREB O
is O
, O
in O
most O
cases O
, O
constitutive O
, O
the O
transactivation O
potential O
of O

is O
regulated O
by O
the O
phosphorylation O
of O
CREB O

recruitment O
of O
CBP GENE

[ O

Our O
data O
demonstrate O
that O
Foxp3 GENE
interferes O
with O
the O
latter O
of O
these O
two O
processes O
and O
that O
the O
recruitment O
of O
the O
coactivator O
protein O
p300 GENE
, O
and O
resulting O
transcriptional O
activation O
are O
blocked O
by O
Foxp3 GENE

This O
may O
be O
the O
result O
of O
the O
physical O
interaction O
we O
detected O
between O

With O

appeared O
less O

The O

on O
basal O

of O
the O
HTLV O

was O
very O
similar O

that O

suggesting O
that O
the O
FKH O

important O
at O
some O
level O

As O
observed O
with O
NF O

, O
the O
Foxp3 GENE

the O

a O

Therefore O
, O
it O
appears O
that O

the O

dispensable O

Our O

The O

When O

that O

The O
work O
reviewed O
in O
this O
article O
separates O
T O
cell O
development O
into O
four O
phases O
. O 

First O
is O
an O
expansion O
phase O
prior O
to O
TCR O
rearrangement O
, O
which O
appears O
to O
be O
correlated O
with O
programming O
of O
at O
least O
some O
response O
genes O
for O
inducibility O
. O 

This O
phase O
can O
occur O
to O
some O
extent O
outside O
of O
the O
thymus O
. O 

However O
, O
the O
profound O
T O
cell O
deficit O
of O
nude O
mice O
indicates O
that O
the O
thymus O
is O
by O
far O
the O
most O
potent O
site O
for O
inducing O
the O
expansion O
per O
se O
, O
even O
if O
other O
sites O
can O
induce O
some O
response O
acquisition O
. O 

Second O
is O
a O
controlled O
phase O
of O
TCR O
gene O
rearrangement O
. O 

The O
details O
of O
the O
regulatory O
mechanism O
that O
selects O
particular O
loci O
for O
rearrangement O
are O
still O
not O
known O
. O 

It O
seems O
that O
the O
rearrangement O
of O
the O
TCR O
gamma O
loci O
in O
the O
gamma O
delta O
lineage O
may O
not O
always O
take O
place O
at O
a O
developmental O
stage O
strictly O
equivalent O
to O
the O
rearrangement O
of O
TCR O
beta O
in O
the O
alpha O
beta O
lineage O
, O
and O
it O
is O
not O
clear O
just O
how O
early O
the O
two O
lineages O
diverge O
. O 

In O
the O
TCR O
alpha O
beta O
lineage O
, O
however O
, O
the O
final O
gene O
rearrangement O
events O
are O
accompanied O
by O
rapid O
proliferation O
and O
an O
interruption O
in O
cellular O
response O
gene O
inducibility O
. O 

The O
loss O
of O
conventional O
responsiveness O
is O
probably O
caused O
by O
alterations O
at O
the O
level O
of O
signaling O
, O
and O
may O
be O
a O
manifestation O
of O
the O
physiological O
state O
that O
is O
a O
precondition O
for O
selection O
. O 

Third O
is O
the O
complex O
process O
of O
selection O
. O 

Whereas O
peripheral O
T O
cells O
can O
undergo O
forms O
of O
positive O
selection O
( O
by O
antigen O
- O
driven O
clonal O
expansion O
) O
and O
negative O
selection O
( O
by O
abortive O
stimulation O
leading O
to O
anergy O
or O
death O
), O
neither O
is O
exactly O
the O
same O
phenomenon O
that O
occurs O
in O
the O
thymic O
cortex O
. O 

Negative O
selection O
in O
the O
cortex O
appears O
to O
be O
a O
suicidal O
inversion O
of O
antigen O
responsiveness O
: O
instead O
of O
turning O
on O
IL GENE
- GENE
2 GENE
expression O
, O
the O
activated O
cell O
destroys O
its O
own O
chromatin O
. O 

The O
genes O
that O
need O
to O
be O
induced O
for O
this O
response O
are O
not O
yet O
identified O
, O
but O
it O
is O
unquestionably O
a O
form O
of O
activation O
. O 

It O
is O
interesting O
that O
in O
humans O
and O
rats O
, O
cortical O
thymocytes O
undergoing O
negative O
selection O
can O
still O
induce O
IL GENE

2R GENE

and O
even O
be O
rescued O
in O

, O
if O

IL GENE
- GENE

is O
provided O
. O 

Perhaps O
murine O
thymocytes O
are O
denied O
this O
form O
of O
rescue O
because O
they O
shut O
off O
IL GENE

2R GENE

its O

Activation O

three O

protein O

It O
is O
known O
that O
the O
stability O

from O

We O

here O
that O

triggers O

This O
observation O

the O
possibility O

the O

formed O

by O

This O
suggests O
other O
mechanisms O
for O
CIITA GENE

induced O
promoter O

, O
such O
as O
an O
effect O
on O

This O
ability O

facilitate O

Finally O

we O
conclude O
that O

We O
first O
found O
that O

inhibited O

as O
the O

In O

NAC O
also O
inhibited O

The O
inhibitory O
effects O

were O
not O
due O

as O
neither O

Finally O
, O
we O
found O
that O
the O
addition O

NAC O

MLR O
between O
naive O
T O
cells O
and O
allogeneic O
DC O
resulted O
in O
a O

which O
could O
be O
attributed O

defect O

independent O

were O
not O

Altogether O

our O

In O

The O

However O
, O
the O

These O

that O

To O
continue O
our O
investigation O
of O
the O
cellular O
events O
that O
occur O
following O
human O
CMV O
( O
HCMV O
) O
infection O
, O
we O
focused O
on O
the O
regulation O
of O
cellular O
activation O

viral O
binding O
to O
human O
monocytes O
. O 

First O
, O
we O
showed O
that O
viral O
binding O
induced O
a O
number O
of O
immunoregulatory O
genes O
( O
IL GENE
- GENE

, O

in O

that O
neutralizing O

the O
major O
HCMV O
glycoproteins O
, O
gB O
( O
UL55 O
) O
and O
gH O
( O
UL75 O
), O
inhibited O
the O
induction O
of O
these O
genes O
. O 

Next O
, O
we O
demonstrated O
that O
these O
viral O
ligands O
directly O
up O
- O
regulated O
monocyte O
gene O
expression O
upon O
their O
binding O
to O
their O
appropriate O
cellular O
receptors O
. O 

We O
then O
investigated O
if O
HCMV O
binding O
also O
resulted O
in O
the O
translation O
and O
secretion O
of O
cytokines O
. O 

Our O
results O
showed O
that O
HCMV O
binding O
to O
monocytes O
resulted O
in O
the O
production O
and O
release O
of O
IL GENE
- GENE
1beta GENE
protein O
. O 

Because O
these O
induced O
gene O
products O
have O
NF O

kappaB O
sites O
in O
their O
promoter O
regions O
, O
we O
next O
examined O
whether O
there O
was O
an O
up O

regulation O
of O

kappaB O
levels O
. O 

These O
experiments O
showed O
that O
, O
in O
fact O
, O
NF O
- O
kappaB O
was O
translocated O
to O
the O
nucleus O
following O
viral O
binding O
or O
purified O
viral O
ligand O

. O 

Changes O
in O
IkappaBalpha GENE
levels O
correlated O
with O
the O
changes O
in O
NF O

kappaB O
translocation O
. O 

Lastly O
, O
we O
demonstrated O
that O
p38 O
kinase O
activity O
played O
a O
central O
role O
in O
IL GENE
- GENE
1beta GENE
production O
and O
that O
it O
was O
rapidly O
up O
- O
regulated O
following O
infection O
. O 

These O
results O
support O
our O
hypothesis O
that O
HCMV O
initiates O
a O
signal O
transduction O
pathway O
that O
leads O
to O
monocyte O
activation O
and O
pinpoints O
a O
potential O
mechanism O
whereby O
HCMV O
infection O
of O

can O
result O
in O
profound O
pathogenesis O
, O

in O
chronic O

Consistent O
with O
these O

we O
have O
previously O

that O

Understanding O
how O

We O
therefore O
reexamined O
this O

using O
two O

that O
allowed O

In O
the O

approach O
, O
stable O

two O
B O

carrying O
an O
LMP1 GENE

under O
the O

of O
an O

were O
induced O
to O

at O

In O
the O
second O
approach O
, O
we O
tested O
the O
generality O

this O

by O
transiently O
expressing O

from O
a O
strong O

All O
six O

tested O
showed O
NF O

and O
this O
was O

in O

In O
the O

but O
never O
any O
effect O
upon O
Bcl GENE

We O
therefore O
conclude O
that O
Bcl GENE
- GENE
2 GENE
upregulation O
is O
part O
of O
the O
panoply O
of O
cellular O
changes O
induced O
by O

that O
the O

Our O

be O
an O

In O

Upregulation O

In O
the O

In O

Therefore O
, O
our O

in O

In O
that O

it O
is O
noteworthy O
that O
TGF GENE

both O

but O
not O
Id1 GENE
( O

Interestingly O
, O
these O
results O
show O
that O
various O

regulate O
Id O

. O 

Id2 GENE

The O

also O
found O

to O
be O
more O
highly O

However O
, O

did O
not O
induce O
significant O
changes O
in O
the O
protein O

of O
Id2 GENE

It O
is O
believed O
that O

block O

promote O
proliferation O
in O
various O

types O
[ O
39 O

by O

with O
these O

It O
has O
been O
proposed O
that O
the O

might O
have O
an O
important O

In O
that O

both O
the O

therefore O
in O

that O

that O

, O
our O
findings O
that O

In O

it O

Altogether O

these O

This O

or O
to O

As O

, O
only O
a O

the O
A3G GENE

is O
able O
to O

In O

to O
the O

Interestingly O
, O

not O
to O
be O
the O
only O

in O

Another O
member O

appears O
to O

). O
A3F GENE

also O

although O

Furthermore O
, O
A3F GENE
proteins O
were O
detected O
in O
many O
tissues O
that O
express O
A3G GENE

are O
able O
to O
form O
heteromultimers O
with O
A3G GENE
( O

Both O

a O

but O
little O
is O
known O
about O

( O

There O
is O
a O

describing O
that O

, O
but O
this O
was O
not O
analyzed O
on O
the O

( O

Since O
the O
A3G GENE

not O
been O
systematically O
analyzed O
so O
far O
, O
our O
aim O
was O
to O
clone O
the O

characterize O
its O

in O

In O
our O
study O
, O
we O
observed O
that O
A3G GENE

By O
generating O
a O

we O
identified O

In O

was O
not O

in O

To O
gain O
a O

understanding O

we O

In O

we O

that O

Thus O

we O

that O

we O

found O
that O

both O

demonstrating O
that O

indeed O
function O
as O
a O

, O
moreover O
, O
that O

The O

is O
one O
of O
a O
few O

It O
is O
a O
potent O

We O
found O
that O
the O

( O

dramatically O

However O
, O

did O
not O
have O
any O

that O

than O

We O

a O

that O

We O
now O
show O
that O
this O

correlates O
with O
the O

In O
both O

also O

although O

Therefore O
, O
only O
the O

However O

that O

This O

We O

Therefore O
, O
we O
utilized O
the O

whether O

Although O

These O

that O

critically O
important O
for O

These O
results O
are O
very O
interesting O
with O

because O
they O
suggest O
that O
the O

that O
the O

As O

that O

only O

that O

regulate O
not O
only O

also O

In O
fact O
, O
cellular O
NF O

was O
phosphorylation O

the O

of O
p65 GENE

containing O
NF O

kappa O

was O
enhanced O
by O
phosphorylation O
in O

. O 

Furthermore O
, O
we O
found O
that O
the O
induction O
by O
hydrogen O

of O

kappa O
B O
translocation O
to O
the O
nucleus O
, O
which O
is O
assumed O
to O
be O
triggered O
by O
reactive O
oxygen O

, O
also O
coincided O
with O

into O
the O

that O
were O

after O

Thus O

The O

Analyses O

the O

we O
found O
that O
two O

We O

Since O
the O

these O
findings O
suggested O
that O
the O

either O

The O

with O
that O
in O

and O
that O
the O
low O

was O
due O
to O

Thus O
, O
NF O

was O
not O
required O
for O
neuroblastoma O

Furthermore O
, O
the O

proved O
that O

that O

properties O

Although O

properties O

were O
similar O
between O

there O
were O
distinguishing O
biological O
properties O

the O

( O

some O

effects O

may O
explain O
the O

Since O

the O

could O
possibly O
contribute O

the O

It O
is O
noteworthy O
that O
expression O

has O
been O
shown O
to O
inhibit O
the O

preventing O

The O

contribute O
to O
the O
bias O
of O
LMP1 GENE

mice O
towards O
B O

. O 

Interestingly O
, O
LMP2 GENE

also O
favors O

of O
B O

cells O
, O
but O
this O
occurs O
in O
the O
absence O

These O
results O
suggest O
that O
the O
mimicry O
of O
B O
cell O
receptor O
signaling O
by O
LMP2 GENE
promotes O
B O
- O
1 O
cell O
differentiation O
but O
not O

[ O
24 O
, O
50 O
, O
51 O

This O
promotion O
of O
B O

may O
account O
for O
the O
ability O
of O
LMP2 GENE
to O
exacerbate O

The O
data O
presented O
in O
this O
study O
indicate O
that O
although O
LMP1 GENE

expressed O
in O
all O
B O

, O
malignancy O
develops O
in O

The O

B O

the O

induce O

. O 

These O

can O
also O
become O
sporadically O

in O

also O
result O
in O

This O
is O
similar O

where O

[ O

Thus O
, O
the O
contribution O
of O
EBV O

tumor O

is O
apparently O
the O
continuous O
activation O

that O

also O
be O
sporadically O

contribute O

( O

Induction O

In O

This O

that O

in O
the O

, O
the O
induction O

further O

that O

to O
our O
knowledge O
this O

the O
first O

this O

The O

confirmed O
by O
the O
striking O
inhibition O

However O
, O
the O

not O
lead O

This O

In O
contrast O

These O
findings O
suggest O
that O

One O

the O

It O
has O
been O
shown O
that O
overstimulation O

with O
agonistic O
antibodies O
inhibits O
GC O

[ O

]. O
Similarly O
, O
due O
to O
mimicry O

, O
transgenic O
LMP1 GENE
mice O
are O
also O
defective O
in O

[ O

The O
constitutive O

by O
LMP1 GENE
likely O
blocks O
GC O
formation O
through O
downregulation O
of O

Interestingly O
, O
clinical O

indicate O
that O

mutually O
exclusive O
in O
non O

Thus O
, O
the O
LMP1 GENE

mirror O

. O 

Although O
the O
activation O
of O
Akt GENE
and O
the O
lack O
of O
Fox01 GENE
in O
the O

suggest O
that O

Indeed O
, O

correlated O

a O

It O
is O

that O
the O

The O

DISCUSSION O
Shortly O
after O
the O
discovery O
of O
APOBEC3G GENE
, O
it O
became O
clear O
that O
this O
human O
gene O
plays O
an O
important O
role O
in O
antiretroviral O
defense O
( O
4 O
). O
Originally O
identified O
as O
a O
restriction O
factor O
of O
HIV O
- O
1 O
infection O
, O
expression O
of O
APOBEC3G GENE
was O
found O
in O
human O
peripheral O
blood O
lymphocytes O
and O
macrophages O
, O
which O
represent O
the O
main O
target O
cells O
for O
HIV O
- O
1 O
( O
32 O
). O
In O
addition O
, O
the O
protein O
was O
detected O
in O
lung O
, O
liver O
, O
spleen O
, O
testis O
and O
ovary O
, O
but O
little O
is O
known O
about O
its O
transcriptional O
regulation O
( O
29 O
, O
32 O
, O
47 O
). O
To O
address O
this O
question O
, O
we O
cloned O
the O
human O
APOBEC3G GENE
promoter O
and O
analyzed O
its O
regulation O
in O
T O
cells O
. O 

Applying O
5 O
'- O
RACE O
, O
we O
identified O
multiple O
start O
sites O
for O
transcription O
of O
the O
A3G GENE
gene O
. O 

This O
observation O
is O
consistent O
with O
the O
fact O
that O
the O
gene O
appears O
to O
lack O
canonical O
CCAAT O
and O
TATA O
boxes O
( O
32 O
), O
a O
condition O
often O
associated O
with O
multiple O
transcriptional O
start O
sites O
( O
49 O
- O
51 O
). O
However O
, O
one O
single O
start O
site O
was O
detected O
in O
6 O
of O
19 O
clones O
and O
was O
designated O
as O
+ O
1 O
. O 

This O
TSS O
is O
located O
66 O
bp O
upstream O
of O
the O
start O
of O
the O
published O
mRNA O
sequence O
( O
GenBanktrade O
NM021822 O
). O
We O
cloned O
a O
1025 O
bp O
promoter O
, O
which O
ranges O
from O
position O
- O
959 O
/+ O
66 O
relative O
to O
the O
identified O
TSS O
. O 

Luciferase GENE
reporter O
assays O
showed O
that O
this O
promoter O
was O
transcriptionally O
active O
in O
A3 O
. O 

01 O
T O
cells O
. O 

Treatment O
with O
the O
phorbol O
ester O
TPA O
did O
not O
further O
enhance O
transcriptional O
activity O
, O
although O
upregulation O
of O
A3G GENE
mRNA O
levels O
in O
T O
cells O
by O
TPA O
has O
been O
described O
( O
33 O
). O
Rose O
et O
al O
. O 

used O
actinomycin O
D O
to O
block O
further O
transcription O
and O
did O
not O
find O
evidence O
for O
enhanced O
mRNA O
stability O
. O 

Therefore O
, O
the O
authors O
suggested O
that O
an O
enhanced O
transcription O
rate O
could O
be O
responsible O
for O
the O
increased O
amount O
of O
A3G GENE
mRNA O
after O
TPA O
treatment O
. O 

However O
, O
the O
promoter O
analysis O
we O
performed O
indicates O
a O
different O
mechanism O
that O
is O
independent O
of O
transcriptional O
regulation O
. O 

In O
addition O
, O
we O
observed O
that O
the O
A3G GENE
promoter O
was O
not O
inducible O
by O
IFN GENE
- GENE
alpha GENE
or O
IFN GENE
- GENE
gamma GENE
in O
A3 O
. O 

01 O
T O
cells O
, O
whereas O
in O
the O
hepatic O
cell O
line O
HepG2 O
, O
a O
moderate O
induction O
was O
measured O
. O 

It O
has O
been O
described O
previously O
that O
A3G GENE
gene O
expression O
is O
upregulated O
by O
interferons O
in O
hepatocytes O
and O
macrophages O
( O
46 O
- O
48 O
, O
52 O
). O
In O
this O
context O
, O
two O
interferon O
- O
responsive O
elements O
have O
been O
identified O
at O
the O
positions O
- O
6 O
/+ O
9 O
and O
+ O
1 O
/+ O
15 O
relative O
to O
the O
TSS O
( O
48 O
). O
Consistent O
with O
this O
data O
, O
we O
observed O
an O
interferon O
induction O
in O
hepatocytes O
for O
the O
fragments O
ranging O
between O
1025 O
and O
120 O
bp O
length O
. O 

The O
activity O
of O
the O
60 O
bp O
fragment O
that O
does O
not O
contain O
these O
motifs O
was O
not O
affected O
. O 

Thus O
, O
the O
induction O
we O
observed O
was O
most O
likely O
mediated O
by O
the O
described O
interferon O
- O
responsive O
elements O
. O 

However O
, O
according O
to O
our O
results O
, O
these O
motifs O
can O
enhance O
transcription O
in O
hepatic O
cells O
, O
but O
not O
in O
T O
cells O
. O 

This O
is O
surprising O
, O
since O
IFN GENE

alpha GENE
- O
inducible O
signaling O
cascades O
are O
present O
in O
A3 O

the O

was O
not O
responsive O
to O
IFN GENE

in O
these O

suggesting O
that O

not O

So O
far O
, O
enhanced O
A3G GENE

is O
clearly O
described O
in O
hepatocytes O

, O
whereas O
the O
situation O
in O

is O
still O
unclear O
. O 

A O
recent O
study O
found O
no O
influence O
of O
IFN GENE

alpha GENE
or O
IFN GENE

gamma GENE
on O
A3G GENE
expression O
in O
resting O

( O

). O
Another O
publication O
describes O
an O
enhanced O
expression O
of O
A3G GENE
after O
IFN GENE

alpha GENE
treatment O
in O
resting O
primary O
CD4 GENE
T O

, O
but O
not O
in O
activated O
T O

( O
53 O
). O
This O
observation O
is O
not O
contradictory O
to O
our O
results O
since O
T O
cell O
lines O
are O
mitotically O
active O
and O
therefore O
rather O
in O
an O
activated O
than O
in O
a O
resting O
state O
. O 

In O
conclusion O
, O
the O
current O
data O
suggests O
that O
regulation O
of O
the O
A3G GENE
promoter O
activity O
by O
interferons O
is O
dependent O
on O
the O
cell O
type O
and O
possibly O
also O
from O
the O
cellular O
activation O
status O
. O 

We O
additionally O
analyzed O
the O
influence O
of O
HIV O

proteins O
on O
A3G GENE
promoter O
activity O
. O 

The O
HIV O
- O
1 O
Vif GENE
protein O
is O
neutralizing O
the O
antiviral O
function O
of O
A3G GENE
by O
a O
multitude O
of O
ways O
. O 

Targeting O
the O
A3G GENE
protein O
for O
proteasomal O
degradation O
is O
considered O
to O
be O
the O
main O
mode O
of O
action O
( O
37 O
- O
41 O
), O
but O
it O
becomes O
more O
and O
more O
clear O
that O
other O
mechanisms O
are O
also O
involved O
. O 

There O
is O
evidence O
that O
Vif GENE
also O
promotes O
exclusion O
of O
A3G GENE
from O
the O
virus O
particles O
and O
an O
influence O
on O
the O
A3G GENE
translation O
process O
is O
discussed O
( O
8 O
, O
42 O
, O
43 O
). O
The O
question O
whether O
Vif GENE
alters O
transcription O
controlled O
by O
the O
A3G GENE
promoter O
has O
not O
been O
analyzed O
so O
far O
. O 

Our O
analysis O
indicates O
that O
transcription O
from O
the O
A3G GENE
promoter O
is O
unaffected O
by O
Vif GENE
or O
other O
HIV O
- O
1 O
proteins O
. O 

Taken O
together O
, O
in O
T O
cell O
lines O
, O
the O
A3G GENE
promoter O
appears O
constitutively O
active O
. O 

By O
generating O
a O
series O
of O
5 O
' O
deletions O
, O
we O
showed O
that O
the O
core O

is O
located O
within O
the O
region O
- O
114 O
/+ O
66 O
relative O
to O
the O
TSS O
. O 

This O
180 O
bp O
promoter O
was O
transcriptionally O
active O
in O
the O
lymphoid O
, O
myeloid O
and O
hepatic O
cell O
lines O
we O
tested O
, O
indicating O
that O
ubiquitous O
transcription O
factors O
are O
involved O
in O
regulation O
of O
A3G GENE
gene O
transcription O
. O 

A O
GC O

box O
with O
the O
sequence O
TGGGCGGGAC O
was O
identified O
at O
position O
- O
87 O
/- O
78 O
of O
the O
A3G GENE
promoter O
. O 

This O
GC O
- O
box O
is O
essential O
for O
basal O
promoter O
activity O
, O
since O
changing O
the O
motif O
to O
TGTTCGGGAC GENE
by O
introducing O
two O
point O
mutations O
strongly O
reduced O
A3G GENE
promoter O
activity O
. O 

The O
transcriptional O
potency O
of O
the O
GC O
- O
box O
was O
further O
demonstrated O
by O
cloning O
it O
upstream O
of O
an O
SV40 O
promoter O
. O 

This O
resulted O
in O
a O
4 O
- O
fold O
enhanced O
transcription O
rate O
. O 

The O
hypothesis O
that O
a O
general O
transcription O
factor O
is O
involved O
in O
regulation O
of O
A3G GENE
transcription O
was O
confirmed O
by O
EMSA O
. O 

Supershift O
analysis O
showed O
that O
the O
transcription O
factors O
Sp1 GENE
and O
Sp3 GENE
which O
are O
ubiquitously O
expressed O
in O
mammalian O
cells O
, O
bind O
specifically O
to O
the O
identified O
motif O
. O 

In O
addition O
, O
the O
binding O
of O
Sp1 GENE
and O
Sp3 GENE
to O
the O
endogenous O
A3G GENE
promoter O
was O
demonstrated O
by O
a O
chromatin O

assay O
. O 

This O
observation O
is O
consistent O
with O
the O
results O
of O
the O
5 O

, O
since O
Sp1 GENE
is O
known O
to O
play O
an O
important O
role O
for O
RNA GENE

to O

to O
the O

and O
is O
associated O
with O
multiple O
transcription O
initiation O
sites O
( O
54 O
- O
56 O
). O
We O
also O
tested O
whether O
overexpression O
of O
Sp1 GENE
or O
Sp3 GENE
proteins O
had O
an O
influence O
on O
A3G GENE

activity O
. O 

Luciferase GENE
assays O
revealed O
that O
A3G GENE
promoter O
activities O
remained O
unchanged O
( O
data O
not O
shown O
), O
most O
probably O
due O
to O
the O
high O
basal O
expression O
level O
of O
the O
endogenous O
Sp1 GENE
and O
/ O
or O
Sp3 GENE
proteins O
. O 

The O
Sp O
family O

of O
many O
housekeeping O
, O
tissue O

, O
viral O
and O

( O
57 O
). O
Whereas O
Sp1 GENE
typically O
acts O
as O
an O
activator O
, O
Sp3 GENE
can O
serve O
as O
a O
repressor O
or O
activator O
( O
57 O
). O
However O
, O
in O
the O
context O
of O
the O
A3G GENE
promoter O
, O
both O
transcription O

serve O
as O
activators O
, O
as O
shown O
by O

of O
the O

Although O
siRNAs O
directed O
against O
Sp1 GENE
or O
Sp3 GENE
significantly O
reduced O
transcription O
controlled O
by O
the O
180 O

, O
transcriptional O
activity O
was O
not O
reduced O
to O
the O
level O
of O
the O
150 O

fragment O
. O 

This O
can O
be O
explained O
by O
the O
remaining O
low O
amounts O
of O
Sp1 GENE

which O
can O
be O
seen O
in O

Alternatively O
, O

be O

Our O

about O
the O

another O

A3F GENE

both O

which O

through O

( O

A O
hallmark O
of O

is O
the O
exclusiveness O
of O

either O

Th2 O
, O
but O
not O
to O

The O
exclusiveness O
of O
this O
mechanism O
is O
provided O
by O
a O
polarization O

where O

its O

To O

we O

a O

that O

We O

We O
showed O
that O

a O

The O

in O
two O

the O
expression O

The O

In O

Hence O
, O
the O

does O
not O
correlate O

The O

regulatory O
element O
( O
NRE O
) O
of O
the O
hepatitis O
B O
virus O
( O
HBV O
) O
core O
promoter O
contains O
three O
subregions O
which O
act O
synergistically O
to O
suppress O
core O

. O 

One O
of O
these O
subregions O

NRE O

, O
is O
active O
in O
both O
HeLa O

and O
was O
found O
to O
be O
bound O
by O
a O
protein O
factor O
present O
in O
both O

types O
. O 

Here O
we O
show O
that O
the O
transcription O

RFX1 GENE
can O
bind O
to O
NRE O
gamma O
and O
transactivate O
the O
core O

this O
site O
. O 

Mutations O
which O
abrogated O
the O
gene O
- O
suppressive O
activity O
of O
NRE O
gamma O
prevented O
RFX1 GENE
from O
binding O
to O
NRE O
gamma O
. O 

In O
addition O
, O
RFX1 GENE
can O
bind O
simultaneously O
, O
most O
likely O
as O
a O
heterodimer O
, O
with O
the O
transcription O

In O
the O
absence O
of O

cloned O
MIBP1 GENE

for O
further O
studies O
, O
we O
hypothesize O
that O

negatively O
regulate O
the O

The O
ability O

the O

For O

As O

The O
third O
approach O
was O
to O

our O

the O

be O
an O

The O

Here O

Although O

fludarabine O
is O
also O
a O

Here O

Fludarabine O
caused O

but O
not O
of O

This O

also O
seen O
in O

Brief O
exposure O

led O
to O
a O

Tat GENE
is O
an O
essential O
regulatory O
protein O
for O
the O
replication O
of O
human O
immunodeficiency O
virus O
( O
HIV O
). O
Mutations O
in O
the O

have O
been O
shown O
to O
block O
HIV O
replication O
in O
human O
T O
cells O
. O 

Several O
studies O
have O
established O
that O
Tat GENE
releases O
an O
elongation O
block O
to O
the O
transcription O
of O
HIV O
long O
terminal O
repeat O
( O
LTR O
); O
however O
, O
it O
is O
not O
known O
whether O
this O
mechanism O
alone O
is O
sufficient O
to O
explain O
the O
block O
to O
HIV O
replication O
in O
human O
T O
cells O
when O
Tat GENE
is O
absent O
. O 

It O
is O
possible O
that O
Tat GENE
is O
also O
needed O
for O
other O
functions O
during O
HIV O
replication O
. O 

To O
test O
these O
hypotheses O
, O
we O
studied O
several O
tat GENE
mutants O
, O
including O
two O
stop O
codon O
mutants O
and O
one O
deletion O
mutant O
using O
replication O

with O

in O

kappa O

and O

or O
Sp1 GENE

In O
this O
study O
, O
we O
show O
that O
Tat GENE
- O
HIV O
- O
1 O
with O
wild O
- O
type O
LTRs O
can O
replicate O
in O
HeLa O
cells O

and O
the O
virus O
produced O
from O
HeLa O
cells O
can O
infect O
primary O
peripheral O
blood O
lymphocytes O
and O
macrophages O
. O 

It O
was O
found O
that O
the O
propagation O
of O
the O
Tat GENE
mutants O
containing O
wild O
- O
type O
LTRs O
was O
less O
efficient O
than O
that O
of O
the O
LTR O
- O
modified O
Tat GENE
mutants O
. O 

Large O
amounts O
of O
viral O
RNA O
and O
particles O
were O
synthesized O
in O
infections O
established O
using O
the O
tat GENE
mutants O
that O
contain O

LTRs O
. O 

However O
, O
this O
efficient O
propagation O
of O
the O
LTR O
- O
modified O
tat GENE
mutants O
was O
restricted O
to O
some O
lymphoid O
cell O
lines O
that O
have O
been O
transformed O
with O
other O
viruses O
. O 

Thus O
, O
despite O
its O
essential O
role O
for O
releasing O
an O
elongation O

, O
Tat GENE
is O
not O
otherwise O
absolutely O

that O

The O
B2 O

was O

in O
the O

only O
upon O

The O
B3 O

only O

In O
this O

we O
demonstrate O
that O

The O

The O

Recent O

that O
the O

As O

function O
as O
both O
an O

and O
a O

of O

we O

of O

on O

in O

We O
found O
that O
two O

repress O

At O

in O
the O
case O

the O

did O
not O
seem O
to O

another O

in O
our O

not O

Exposure O
to O
NSAIDs O
had O
a O
complex O
effect O
on O

while O

. O 

In O
addition O
, O
only O
a O
subset O

These O
findings O
reflect O
the O
properties O
of O
HSF1 GENE
which O
can O
be O
activated O
to O
at O

two O
DNA O

forms O
only O
one O
of O
which O
activates O

that O
individual O

one O

Overall O
therefore O
, O
exposure O

NSAIDs O
leads O
to O
a O
profound O

Previous O

Our O

we O
hypothesized O
that O

However O
, O
since O

we O
also O

not O
affect O

found O
that O

after O

( O

The O

therefore O
, O

However O
, O

lack O

, O
which O
may O
explain O
the O
failure O
of O

CONCLUSIONS O
: O
Leukocyte O

The O

that O

Because O

we O
constructed O
strains O

the O

whether O

We O
found O
that O
resistance O

requires O
the O
function O
of O
both O

because O

still O

This O
implied O
that O
a O

One O
of O

the O

One O

the O

For O
these O
reasons O
, O
the O
5 O

was O
used O
to O
identify O
the O

A O

capable O

Within O

we O

One O

is O
similar O
to O
a O

and O
a O
region O
located O
at O
position O

contains O
a O

Two O
domains O
centered O
at O
positions O

345 O
and O

respectively O
, O
bind O
proteins O
that O
are O

Finally O
, O
two O
other O
domains O

located O

positions O

, O
interact O
with O
proteins O

In O
addition O
, O
deletion O

the O

these O
two O

results O
in O
a O

It O
is O
very O

that O
these O

The O
70 O

protein O
( O

is O
a O
highly O
conserved O
, O
ubiquitous O
protein O
involved O
in O

cellular O

Here O
we O
show O
that O
when O
added O
exogenously O

cells O
, O
Hsp70 O
is O
readily O
imported O
into O
both O
cytoplasmic O
and O
nuclear O
compartments O
in O
a O
cell O

type O

We O
exploited O
this O
ability O
of O
Hsp70 O
to O
deliver O
NF O
- O
kappaB O
, O
a O
key O
transcriptional O
regulator O
of O
inflammatory O

. O 

We O
demonstrate O
that O
a O
fusion O
protein O
composed O
of O
a O
C O

terminal O
Hsp70 O
peptide O

the O
p50 GENE

, O
could O
bind O

We O
therefore O
propose O
that O
Hsp70 O
can O
be O
used O
as O
a O
vehicle O
for O
intracytoplasmic O

intranuclear O

Discussion O
The O
current O
study O
reveals O
that O
FOXP3 GENE
induction O
, O
an O
important O
step O
in O
iTreg O
commitment O
, O
is O
inhibited O
by O
GATA3 GENE
, O
which O
is O
the O
key O
regulator O
for O
polarization O
toward O
Th2 O
cells O
. O 

After O
differentiation O
, O
the O
effector O
Th2 O
cells O
become O
refractory O
to O
conversion O
into O
a O
FOXP3 GENE
+ O
phenotype O
. O 

In O
accordance O
with O
other O
studies O
, O
we O
found O
that O
CD4 GENE
+ O
CD25 GENE
- O
cells O
were O
able O
to O
up O
- O
regulate O
FOXP3 GENE
[ O
12 O
, O
27 O
]. O
Already O
- O
committed O
cells O
such O
as O
memory O
T O
cells O
and O
Th1 O
cells O
showed O
only O
moderate O
and O
transient O
FOXP3 GENE
induction O
, O
which O
is O
not O
sufficient O
to O
change O
the O
phenotype O
toward O
a O
regulatory O
T O
cell O
profile O
. O 

In O
contrast O
, O
naive O
T O
cells O
could O
efficiently O
up O
- O
regulate O
FOXP3 GENE
when O
treated O
with O
TGF GENE
- GENE
beta GENE
to O
induce O
iTreg O
cells O
[ O
10 O
, O
28 O
- O
34 O
], O
suggesting O
that O
FOXP3 GENE
plays O
an O
important O
role O
in O
the O
early O
differentiation O
process O
and O
may O
act O
in O
a O
way O
similar O
to O
that O
known O
for O
the O
Th1 O
/ O
Th2 O
decision O
factors O
T GENE
- GENE
bet GENE
and O
GATA3 GENE
. O 

This O
commitment O
is O
characterized O
by O
competitive O
expression O
of O
these O
factors O
[ O
35 O
, O
36 O
], O
which O
we O
also O
observed O
in O
differentiating O
FOXP3 GENE
+ O
iTreg O
cells O
including O
a O
phase O
of O
co O
- O
expression O
, O
which O
turns O
into O
nonoverlapping O
expression O
upon O
completed O
differentiation O
. O 

In O
this O
competitive O
process O
TGF GENE
- GENE
beta GENE
appeared O
to O
be O
mandatory O
for O
the O
induction O
of O
FOXP3 GENE
, O
possibly O
by O
keeping O
the O
expression O
of O
GATA3 GENE
and O
T GENE
- GENE
bet GENE
low O
[ O
37 O
, O
38 O
]. O
In O
contrast O
, O
differentiating O
naive O
T O
cells O
in O
the O
absence O
of O
polarization O
factors O
( O
Th0 O
) O

as O

, O
IL GENE
- GENE
12 GENE
, O
or O
TGF GENE

beta GENE
showed O
only O
a O
transient O
FOXP3 GENE
expression O
and O
failed O
to O
generate O
a O
population O
of O
FOXP3 GENE

expressing O
cells O
, O
but O
GATA3 GENE
and O
T GENE
- GENE
bet GENE
were O
up O
- O
regulated O
( O
unpublished O

Interestingly O
, O
as O
we O
and O
others O
previously O
described O
, O
FOXP3 GENE

promoting O
factors O
, O
such O
as O

are O
also O
known O
as O
inhibitors O
of O
GATA3 GENE

[ O
42 O

45 O
]. O
Therefore O
GATA3 GENE
not O
only O
induces O
differentiation O
into O
Th2 O
cells O
but O
also O
inhibits O
FOXP3 GENE
expression O
and O
commitment O
into O
iTreg O

. O 

The O

IL GENE

not O

was O
able O
to O
inhibit O

FOXP3 GENE

and O
therefore O
prevented O

To O
prove O
the O

effect O
of O
IL GENE

on O

in O

, O
we O
treated O
mice O
with O
IL GENE

This O
has O
been O
shown O
to O
increase O
the O
effect O
of O
the O
cytokine O
in O

[ O
19 O

Only O
the O

Our O
results O
suggest O
that O
IL GENE

4 GENE
is O
only O
interfering O
with O
the O
differentiation O
of O
naive O
T O

into O
iTreg O

. O 

But O
since O
a O
distinction O
of O
nTreg O
and O
iTreg O
cells O
is O
currently O
not O
possible O
, O
because O
iTreg O
cells O
also O
transiently O
express O
CD25 GENE
after O
activation O
, O
we O
cannot O
exclude O
that O
IL GENE
- GENE
4 GENE
may O
also O
inhibit O
Foxp3 GENE
expression O
in O
nTreg O
cells O
in O

or O
that O
additional O
effects O
may O
contribute O
to O
the O
observed O
drop O
in O
Foxp3 GENE
expression O
. O 

IL GENE
- GENE
4 GENE
has O
already O
been O
shown O
to O
negatively O
regulate O
the O
development O
of O
naive O
T O
cells O
into O
Th1 O
or O
the O
IL GENE
- GENE
17 GENE
- O
producing O
T O
cells O
( O
Th17 O
) O
[ O
46 O
, O
47 O
]. O
Similar O
effects O
have O
been O
recently O
described O
for O
IL GENE
- GENE
6 GENE
, O
which O
, O
combined O
with O
TGF GENE

beta GENE
, O
inhibits O
the O
generation O
of O
iTreg O

and O
induces O
differentiation O
into O
the O
Th17 O
cells O
by O
an O
unknown O
mechanism O
[ O
48 O
, O
49 O
]. O
Thus O
the O
polarization O
into O
iTreg O
cells O
is O
negatively O
regulated O
by O
the O
effector O
cytokines O
IL GENE
- GENE
4 GENE
and O
IL GENE
- GENE
6 GENE
. O 

IL GENE
- GENE
4 GENE
has O
been O
previously O
shown O
to O
induce O
the O

of O
FOXP3 GENE

Treg O
cells O
out O
of O
CD4 GENE

CD25 GENE
- O
[ O
50 O
]. O
In O
those O
experiments O
, O
the O
concentrations O
of O
IL GENE
- GENE
4 GENE
used O
were O
low O
, O
and O
as O
we O
also O
observed O
, O
IL GENE
- GENE
4 GENE
at O
low O
concentration O
slightly O
enhanced O
FOXP3 GENE
expression O
. O 

Importantly O
, O
these O
concentrations O
were O
not O
sufficient O
to O
induce O
GATA3 GENE

. O 

IL GENE
- GENE
4 GENE
may O
favor O
proliferation O
of O
nTreg O

[ O

] O
or O
directly O
regulate O
FOXP3 GENE
expression O
in O
a O
STAT O

fashion O
[ O
51 O

Since O
IL GENE
- GENE
13 GENE
does O
not O
effectively O
reduce O
FOXP3 GENE
and O
fails O
to O
induce O
GATA3 GENE
, O
we O
hypothesized O
that O
the O
IL GENE

4 GENE
- O
dependent O
inhibition O
of O
FOXP3 GENE
could O
be O
mediated O
by O
GATA3 GENE
. O 

In O
fact O
, O
GATA3 GENE

inducing O
IL GENE

concentrations O
repressed O

, O
whereas O
IL GENE
- GENE
4 GENE
as O

as O
TGF GENE

were O
intact O
. O 

This O
result O
suggested O
a O
competitive O
mechanism O
between O
GATA3 GENE
and O
FOXP3 GENE
transcription O
factors O
in O
determining O
lineage O
commitment O
during O
the O
early O
phase O
of O
differentiation O
. O 

Accordingly O
, O
we O
investigated O
naturally O
high O
GATA3 GENE

expressing O
cells O
and O
confirmed O
the O
absence O
of O
FOXP3 GENE
. O 

Protein O
transduction O
of O
GATA3 GENE
into O
naive O
T O
cells O
inhibited O
FOXP3 GENE
induction O
in O
human O
, O
differentiating O
, O
naive O
T O
cells O
. O 

This O
inhibitory O
effect O
of O
GATA3 GENE
was O
further O
confirmed O
in O
BALB O

c O
transgenic O
mice O
, O
expressing O

in O

( O
DO11 O

10 O

). O
In O
line O
with O
the O
transient O
overexpression O
of O
GATA3 GENE
in O
human O
T O
cells O
, O
cells O
of O
these O
mice O
failed O
to O
induce O
FOXP3 GENE
expression O
upon O
exposure O
with O

in O
the O
presence O
of O
TGF GENE

beta GENE
. O 

Strikingly O
, O
the O
DO11 O
. O 

10 O
: O
CD2 GENE
- O
GATA3 GENE
mice O
do O
have O
peripheral O
FOXP3 GENE

which O
however O
displayed O

% O
lower O
frequency O
compared O
to O

type O
DO11 O
. O 

10 O
mice O
. O 

Thus O
GATA3 GENE
restrains O
the O
development O
of O
certain O
Treg O
subsets O
, O
presumably O
the O
inducible O
, O
peripheral O
population O
and O
not O
those O
of O
thymic O
origin O

Thymic O
T O

undergo O
a O

maturation O
process O
, O
which O
may O
explain O
the O
insensitivity O
of O
nTreg O
to O
GATA3 GENE
overexpression O
[ O
52 O
]. O
In O
contrast O
to O
the O
Th2 O
- O
differentiating O
and O
iTreg O
- O
inhibiting O
function O
of O
GATA3 GENE
in O
peripheral O

, O
GATA3 GENE
acts O
in O
the O
thymus O
together O
with O
other O

such O
as O
the O
Repressor GENE

GATA3 GENE

in O
the O

or O
participates O
in O
complex O

to O
regulate O

[ O

Therefore O
, O
the O
role O
of O
GATA3 GENE
appears O
to O
be O
tissue O
specific O
and O
cannot O
be O
generalized O
. O 

Our O

demonstrates O
that O
GATA3 GENE
repressed O

directly O
by O

A O

located O
303 O

which O
we O
have O
previously O

as O
the O
FOXP3 GENE

[ O

Site O

of O
this O
site O
increased O
the O
activity O

thus O
revealing O
the O
repressive O
nature O
of O
this O
GATA O
element O
in O
memory O
T O
cells O
, O
which O
naturally O
express O

whereas O
no O

was O
seen O
in O

, O
which O
do O
not O
express O
GATA3 GENE

This O
palindromic O
GATA O
element O
is O
bound O
by O
GATA3 GENE
protein O
as O
proven O
with O

down O
experiments O
. O 

Furthermore O
, O
it O
is O
shown O
by O
ChIP O
that O
GATA3 GENE
binds O
this O
element O
also O
in O
intact O

. O 

It O
is O
known O
that O
GATA3 GENE
can O
induce O

by O
chromatin O

by O
directly O

[ O

or O

as O

in O
the O

acts O
as O
a O
repressor O
of O

expression O
[ O
21 O
, O
57 O

Therefore O
keeping O

low O
might O
be O
required O
to O
induce O
efficient O
FOXP3 GENE

The O
molecular O
interactions O
enabling O
GATA3 GENE
to O
inhibit O
FOXP3 GENE
are O
not O
identified O
yet O

but O
the O

the O

In O
summary O
, O
we O
demonstrated O
that O
FOXP3 GENE
is O
negatively O

GATA3 GENE
acts O
as O
an O

We O
therefore O
describe O

how O

avoids O

These O

Neutrophil O

Neutrophil O

A O

Retinoic O

A O

Here O

we O

that O

Although O

this O

We O

To O

we O

that O

However O

In O
this O

the O

Although O

PPAR O

However O
, O

In O

It O

Furthermore O
the O

we O

Most O

However O

that O

Introduction O
The O
protein O
kinase O
D O
( O
PKD O
) O
serine O
/ O
threonine O
kinase O
family O
has O
three O
members O
: O
PKD1 GENE
, O
PKD2 GENE
and O
PKD3 GENE
. O 

Most O
cell O
types O
express O
at O
least O
two O
PKD O
isoforms O
but O
PKD O
enzymes O
are O
especially O
highly O
expressed O
in O
haematopoietic O
cells O
, O
where O
they O
are O
activated O
in O
response O
to O
antigen O
receptors O

[ O
2 O
, O
3 O
]. O
A O
conserved O
signalling O
pathway O
linking O
antigen O
receptors O
to O
PKDs O
involves O
the O
activation O
of O
PLCgamma O
and O
the O
subsequent O
production O
of O
diacylglycerol O
( O
DAG O
) O
which O
stimulates O
classical O
and O

or O
novel O
protein O
kinase O
Cs O
( O
PKC O

that O

serine O
residues O
in O
the O

loop O
of O
PKD O
kinases O
[ O

]. O
The O
N O
- O
terminal O
regulatory O
region O
of O
PKD O
enzymes O
contains O
a O
DAG O
binding O
domain O
and O
direct O
binding O
of O
DAG O
also O
contributes O
to O
PKD1 GENE
activation O
[ O

as O
well O
as O
regulating O
the O
spatial O
location O
of O
PKD O
enzymes O
within O
cells O
[ O
8 O
- O
12 O
]. O
PKD O
enzymes O
have O
been O
proposed O
to O
regulate O
numerous O
cellular O
functions O
, O
including O
cell O
proliferation O
[ O
13 O

], O
anti O

Expression O
of O

PKDs O

also O
modify O
Golgi O

, O
cell O

and O
cell O
motility O
( O
reviewed O
in O
[ O

In O
particular O
, O
PKDs O
have O
been O
widely O
linked O
to O
the O
activation O
of O
the O
NFkappaB O

and O
in O
regulating O
cell O

during O

Another O

To O

the O
biological O
role O

PKDs O
we O
have O
generated O

that O
lack O

of O
one O

of O
the O

the O
issue O
of O

Previous O

have O
shown O
that O
PKDs O
are O
indispensable O
for O
HDAC O

[ O

Herein O
we O
show O
that O
PKDs O
are O
also O
indispensable O
for O

in O
B O
cells O
. O 

However O
, O

Moreover O
, O
loss O

PKD O

these O

very O

evidence O

how O

came O
from O
a O
report O

These O

A O
recent O

[ O

further O
demonstrated O
that O
Foxp3 GENE

inhibit O

as O

the O

these O

suggested O
that O

function O

In O

Now O

When O

This O

When O

it O

We O

The O

DISCUSSION O
This O
study O
demonstrates O
that O
RUNX GENE
transcription GENE
factors GENE
1 GENE
and O
3 GENE
play O
an O
important O
role O
in O
the O
generation O
of O
FOXP3 GENE
+ O
iT O
reg O
cells O
by O
TGF O
- O
beta O
. O 

TGF GENE
- GENE
beta GENE
mediates O
RUNX GENE
induction O
and O
FOXP3 GENE
is O
efficiently O
up O
- O
regulated O
by O
RUNX1 GENE
and O
RUNX3 GENE
in O
human O
CD4 GENE
+ O
T O
cells O
. O 

There O
are O
three O
putative O
RUNX O
binding O
sites O
in O
the O
proximal O
FOXP3 GENE
promoter O
. O 

One O
binding O
site O
was O
predicted O
as O
a O
binding O
site O
for O
RUNX2 GENE
. O 

Promoter O
enzyme O
immunoassay O
results O
showed O
that O
binding O
of O
RUNX1 GENE
and O
RUNX3 GENE
also O
occurred O
at O
this O
site O
( O
as O
well O
as O
at O
the O
other O
two O
), O
which O
were O
initially O
identified O
as O
RUNX1 O
binding O
sites O
. O 

This O
finding O
is O
not O
surprising O
because O
RUNX GENE
proteins O
bind O
to O
promoter O
or O
enhancer O
elements O
of O
their O
target O
genes O
via O
the O
runt O
domain O
, O
which O
is O
conserved O
between O
members O
of O
the O
RUNX GENE
family O
. O 

The O
RUNX GENE
protein O
that O
actually O
induces O
the O
expression O
of O
FOXP3 GENE
might O
therefore O
be O
dependent O
on O
the O
availability O
of O
the O
specific O
RUNX GENE
family O
member O
at O
certain O
stages O
of O
T O
cell O
development O
. O 

RUNX GENE
proteins O
are O
able O
to O
increase O
or O
inhibit O
transcriptional O
activity O
of O
their O
target O
genes O
depending O
on O
the O
cell O
type O
and O
the O
target O
gene O
( O
Otto O
et O
al O
., O
2003 O
). O
Mutation O
of O
only O
one O
of O
the O
three O
binding O
sites O
had O
only O
a O
little O
effect O
on O
the O
promoter O
activity O
; O
however O
, O
when O
two O
binding O
sites O
were O
mutated O
, O
the O
FOXP3 GENE
promoter O
activity O
dropped O
to O
a O
greater O
extent O
. O 

The O
most O
striking O
effect O
was O
observed O
when O
all O
three O
binding O
sites O
were O
mutated O
. O 

We O
therefore O
assume O
that O
these O
binding O
sites O
have O
partially O
redundant O
functions O
, O
but O
binding O
to O
at O
least O
two O
sites O
seems O
to O
be O
necessary O
for O
full O
promoter O
activation O
. O

The O

in O

human O
T O

observed O
that O

this O

This O
relationship O
of O

Foxp3 GENE

probably O

be O
the O

( O

All O
