O : 
O Substantial

O treated

O As2O3 
O may 
O prove 
O useful 
O in

O Much 
O of 
O our 
O focus focu 
O in 
O understanding 
O Th1 
O / 
O Th2 
O development 
O has 
O been 
O on 
O the

O and

GENE - 
GENE 4 
O as 
O final 
O determinants determinant 
O of

O Because 
O extinction 
O of 
O IL 
O - 
O 12 
O signaling 
O in 
O early 
O Th2 
O development 
O could 
O potentially 
O be 
O important 
O in 
O imprinting 
O a 
O more 
O permanent 
O Th2 
O phenotype 
O on 
O a 
O population 
O of

O cells cell 
O , 
O we 
O have 
O also 
O examined 
O various variou 
O parameters parameter 
O regulating 
O the

O in

O We 
O propose 
O that 
O Th1 
O development 
O can 
O be 
O considered 
O in 
O two 
O stages stage 
O , 
O capacitance 
O and

O Capacitance 
O would 
O simply

O subunit subunits

O The 
O second

O we 
O propose 
O is 
O the 
O true 
O IL

O In

O this thi 
O may 
O also 
O occur 
O via

GENE - 
GENE alpha 
O , 
O which 
O is 
O able 
O to 
O activate

O . 

O It 
O is 
O perhaps perhap 
O possible 
O that 
O all 
O of

O action actions 
O on

O development 
O may 
O be 
O exert 
O directly 
O by

O , 
O however
