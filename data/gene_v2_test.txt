are are
a a
family family
of of
cytokines cytokine
that that
have have
antiviral antiviral
and and
antiproliferative antiproliferative
effects effect
. 

Data Data
regarding regarding
the the
processes processe
by by
which which
these these
cytokines cytokine
transduce transduce
signals signal
from from
the the
cell cell
membrane membrane
to to
the the
nucleus nucleu
are are
becoming becoming
increasingly increasingly
complex complex
. 

The The
most most
characterized characterized
pathway pathway
is is
via via
JAK JAK

established established
a a
potential potential
role role
for for
the the
Src Src

. 

Therefore Therefore
, ,
this thi
study study
was was
designed designed
to to
analyze analyze
the the
role role
of of
Lck Lck
in in
IFN IFN

The The
results result
show show
that that
IFN IFN

Introduction Introduction
Rheumatoid Rheumatoid
arthritis arthriti
( (
RA RA
) )
is is
characterized characterized
by by
infiltrations infiltration
of of
macrophages macrophage
and and
T T
cells cell
into into
the the
joint joint
, ,
and and
synovial synovial
hyperplasia hyperplasia
. 

Proinflammatory Proinflammatory
cytokines cytokine
released released
from from
these these
cells cell
are are
known known
to to
be be
important important
in in
the the
destruction destruction
of of
joints joint
in in
RA RA
[ [

The The
favorable favorable
clinical clinical

( (
TNF TNF
)- )-
alpha alpha
) )
and and
interleukin interleukin
( (
IL IL
)- )-
1 1
suggest suggest
that that
the the
blockade blockade
of of
key key
inflammatory inflammatory
cytokines cytokine
has has
been been
the the
important important
issue issue
in in
the the
development development
of of
new new
therapeutic therapeutic
applications application
[ [

A A
little little
over over
a a
decade decade
ago ago
, ,
the the
primacy primacy
of of
T T
cells cell
in in
the the
pathogenesis pathogenesi
of of
autoimmune autoimmune
disease disease
such such
as as
RA RA
was was
undisputed undisputed
because because
they they
are are
the the
largest largest
cell cell
population population
infiltrating infiltrating
the the
synovium synovium
. 

However However
, ,
a a
series serie
of of
studies studie
demonstrated demonstrated
paucity paucity
of of
T T
cell cell
- -
derived derived
cytokines cytokine
such such
as as
IL IL
- -
2 2
and and
interferon interferon

gamma gamma
in in
the the
joints joint
of of
RA RA
, ,
whereas wherea
macrophage macrophage
and and
fibroblast fibroblast
cytokines cytokine
including including

18 18
and and
TNF TNF

alpha alpha
were were
abundant abundant
in in
rheumatoid rheumatoid
synovium synovium
. 

This Thi
paradox paradox
has has
questioned questioned
the the
role role
of of
T T
cells cell
in in
the the
pathogenesis pathogenesi
of of
RA RA
[ [
3 3
]. ].
Because Because
we we
have have
already already
demonstrated demonstrated
the the
enhanced enhanced
proliferation proliferation
of of
antigen antigen
specific specific
T T
cells cell
, ,
especially especially
to to
type type
II II
collagen collagen
, ,
and and
the the
skewing skewing
of of
T T
helper helper
type type
1 1
( (
Th1 Th1
) )
cytokines cytokine
in in
RA RA
[ [
4 4
], ],
the the
role role
of of
T T
cells cell
needs need
to to
be be
elucidated elucidated
in in
different different
aspects aspect
. 

IL IL
- -
17 17
is is
one one
of of
the the
inflammatory inflammatory
cytokines cytokine
secreted secreted
mainly mainly
by by
activated activated
T T
cells cell
, ,
which which
can can
induce induce
IL IL

6 6
and and
IL IL
- -
8 8
by by
fibroblasts fibroblast
[ [
5 5
]. ].
This Thi
cytokine cytokine
is is
of of
interest interest
for for
two two
major major
reasons reason
: :
first first
, ,
similarly similarly
to to
TNF TNF
- -
alpha alpha
and and
IL IL
- -
1 1
, ,
IL IL
- -
17 17
has has
proinflammatory proinflammatory
properties propertie
; ;
second second
, ,
it it
is is
produced produced
by by
T T
cells cell
[ [
6 6
]. ].
Recent Recent
observations observation
demonstrated demonstrated
that that
IL IL
- -
17 17
can can
also also
activate activate
osteoclastic osteoclastic
bone bone
resorption resorption
by by
the the
induction induction
of of
RANKL RANKL
( (

ligand ligand
), ),
which which
is is
involved involved
in in
bony bony
erosion erosion
in in
RA RA
[ [
7 7
]. ].
It It
also also
stimulates stimulate
the the
production production
of of
IL IL

6 6
and and
leukemia leukemia
inhibitory inhibitory
factor factor
by by
synoviocytes synoviocyte
, ,
and and
of of
prostaglandin prostaglandin
E2 E2
and and
nitric nitric

and and
has has
the the
ability ability
to to
differentiate differentiate
and and
activate activate
the the
dendritic dendritic
cells cell
[ [
8 8

]. ].
Levels Level
of of
IL IL

17 17
in in
synovial synovial
fluids fluid
were were
significantly significantly
higher higher
in in
patients patient
with with
RA RA
than than
in in
patients patient
with with
osteoarthritis osteoarthriti
( (
OA OA
), ),
and and
it it
was was
produced produced
by by
CD4 CD4

in in
the the
synovium synovium
[ [
11 11
, ,
12 12

IL IL
- -
15 15
, ,
secreted secreted
from from
activated activated
macrophages macrophage
, ,
has has
been been
reported reported
to to
be be
an an
important important
trigger trigger
of of
IL IL

17 17
production production
in in
RA RA
peripheral peripheral

cells cell
( (
PBMC PBMC
) )
by by

and and
steroid steroid
sensitive sensitive
pathways pathway
[ [

]. ].
Recently Recently
, ,
Happel Happel
and and
colleagues colleague
also also
showed showed
that that
IL IL

23 23
could could
be be
an an
efficient efficient
trigger trigger
of of

production production
from from
both both
CD4 CD4

and and
CD8 CD8

Although Although
the the
contribution contribution
of of
IL IL

17 17
in in
joint joint
inflammation inflammation
in in
RA RA
has has
been been
documented documented
in in
earlier earlier
studies studie
[ [
12 12

the the
intracellular intracellular
signal signal

pathway pathway
for for
IL IL

17 17
production production
remains remain
uncertain uncertain
. 

In In
the the
present present
study study
we we
used used
various variou
stimuli stimuli
to to
investigate investigate
IL IL

17 17
production production
in in
PBMC PBMC
of of
patients patient
with with
RA RA
and and
its its
signaling signaling

. 

We We
found found
that that
the the
intracellular intracellular

in in
the the
overproduction overproduction
of of
the the
key key

These These
results result
might might
provide provide
new new

The The

The The
mechanism mechanism
of of
silencing silencing
of of

has has
been been
studied studied
extensively extensively

In In

epsilon epsilon
is is
activated activated

silenced silenced
autonomously autonomously
[ [

although although
in in

epsilon epsilon
also also

All All
the the

responsible responsible

are are
within within
the the
epsilon epsilon

or or
in in

suggesting suggesting
that that

is is

Thus Thu

it it

a a

One One
of of
the the
most most
important important
cytokines cytokine
involved involved
in in
immune immune
response response
regulation regulation
is is
interleukin interleukin
2 2
( (
IL IL

a a
potent potent
activator activator
of of
the the
proliferation proliferation
and and

not not

. 

While While
the the
binding binding
of of
IL IL

2 2
to to
its its
receptor receptor
was was
recently recently
shown shown
to to
lead lead
to to
the the
activation activation

two two

to to
the the
activation activation
of of
specific specific
genes gene
had had
not not
been been
characterized characterized
. 

Since Since
many many
cytokines cytokine
that that
activate activate
Jak Jak
kinases kinase
also also
lead lead
to to
the the
tyrosine tyrosine

and and
activation activation
of of
members member

the the

examined examined

found found
to to

Much Much
of of
our our
focus focu

has has
been been
on on

and and

as as
final final
determinants determinant
of of

. 

Because Because
extinction extinction
of of
IL IL

12 12
signaling signaling
in in
early early
Th2 Th2
development development
could could
potentially potentially
be be
important important
in in

a a

on on
a a

of of

we we
have have
also also
examined examined
various variou
parameters parameter
regulating regulating
the the
IL IL

12 12

pathway pathway
. 

Whereas Wherea
IL IL

to to
repress repres

and and
IFN IFN

alpha alpha
in in
the the
human human
appear appear
to to
induce induce

and and
promote promote

We We
propose propose
that that
Th1 Th1
development development
can can
be be
considered considered
in in
two two
stages stage
, ,
capacitance capacitance
and and
development development
. 

Capacitance Capacitance
would would
simply simply
involve involve

regulated regulated

and and
IFNs IFN
. 

The The
second second
stage stage
, ,
development development
, ,
we we
propose propose
is is
the the
true true
IL IL

12 12
induced induced
developmental developmental
stage stage
, ,
involving involving
expression expression
of of
Stat4 Stat4

. 

In In
the the
human human

this thi
may may
also also
occur occur
via via
IFN IFN

which which
is is
able able
to to
activate activate

. 

It It
is is
perhaps perhap
possible possible
that that
all all
of of

actions action
on on

may may
be be
exert exert

however however
we we
suggest suggest
that that

more more
likely likely

may may

to to

Our Our

provides provide
novel novel

that that

We We
confirmed confirmed

Because Because
of of
the the
multiple multiple
band band
shifts shift
observed observed
for for
NFAT NFAT

( (

), ),
one one
could could
speculate speculate
that that
there there
is is
activation activation
of of
several several
different different
NFAT NFAT
isoforms isoform
, ,
probably probably
derived derived
from from
alternative alternative
splicing splicing
[ [

Interestingly Interestingly
, ,
the the
GP GP

induced induced
transcription transcription
factor factor
binding binding
transformed transformed
only only
into into
a a
very very
limited limited
cytokine cytokine

, ,
namely namely
IL IL

8 8
and and
IL IL

1RA 1RA
( (

Hence Hence
, ,
our our
data data
are are
in in
aggreement aggreement

In In

Results Result

[ [

pointed pointed
to to
an an

which which
might might
be be
the the
case case
for for

[ [

seems seem
also also
possible possible
. 

The The

exhibits exhibit
a a
preferentially preferentially

and and
thus thu
differs differ
from from
the the

described described
for for
TNFalpha TNFalpha
and and
IL IL

1beta 1beta
[ [
27 27

supporting supporting
the the
idea idea
of of
regulating regulating
NFkappaB NFkappaB

through through
combinatorial combinatorial
associations association
of of
the the
subunits subunit
and and
the the
specific specific
sequence sequence
of of
the the
decameric decameric
kappaB kappaB

[ [
41 41
, ,
42 42
]. ].
Unlike Unlike
LPS LPS
or or
TSST TSST

1 1
, ,
we we
found found
that that
GP GP
did did
not not
induce induce
IL IL

1beta 1beta
, ,
but but
it it
strongly strongly
induced induced
IL IL

1RA 1RA
, ,
suggesting suggesting
an an
immediate immediate
anti anti

inflammatory inflammatory
potential potential
of of
GP GP
. 

Analysing Analysing
the the
IL IL

1RA 1RA

[ [
34 34
], ],
we we
discovered discovered
four four
new new
binding binding
sites site
( (

): ):
an an
NFkappaB3 NFkappaB3
site site
( (
between between

), ),
an an

(- (-
471 471
and and

Our Our
data data
indicated indicated
that that
GP GP
leads lead
to to
production production
of of
IL IL

1RA 1RA
primarily primarily
via via
induction induction
of of
NFATP2 NFATP2
/ /
3 3
and and
NFIL NFIL
- -
6 6
DNA DNA

, ,
which which
might might
be be
due due
to to
differences difference
in in
the the
binding binding
motif motif
or or
the the
composition composition
of of
the the
activated activated
transcription transcription
factors factor
( (
NFAT NFAT

might might
suggest suggest
that that
these these

each each

and and
necessary necessary
for for

Regarding Regarding
cellular cellular

, ,
both both

monocytes monocyte
as as
well well
as as
neutrophils neutrophil
have have
been been
reported reported
to to
produce produce

[ [
32 32
]. ].
Flow Flow
cytometric cytometric

seemed seemed
to to
confirm confirm
that that
monocytes monocyte
and and
neutrophils neutrophil
were were
able able
to to
produce produce
IL IL

just just
as as
IL IL

1RA 1RA
in in
response response
to to
GP GP
( (
data data

). ).
This Thi
GP GP

cytokine cytokine

was was
substantially substantially
more more
restricted restricted
than than
that that
of of
LPS LPS
or or
TSST TSST
- -
1 1
, ,
which which
is is
likely likely
due due
to to
differences difference
in in
recognition recognition
and and
signaling signaling
between between
LPS LPS
, ,
TSST TSST
- -
1 1
and and
GP GP
. 

Recognition Recognition
of of
LPS LPS
is is
mainly mainly
mediated mediated
through through
Toll Toll

like like
receptor receptor
4 4
and and
subsequent subsequent
signaling signaling
via via
the the
NFkappaB NFkappaB
pathway pathway
, ,
leading leading
to to
expression expression
of of
pro pro

like like
TNFalpha TNFalpha
[ [

Altogether Altogether
, ,
the the
induction induction
of of
the the
neutrophil neutrophil

and and
the the
anti anti

Potentially Potentially
even even
more more
relevant relevant
than than
the the

, ,
we we
found found
that that

in in
the the
presence presence
of of
other other

( (

ameliorated ameliorated

similar similar
to to

at at
the the
same same
time time
there there
was was
a a
synergistic synergistic
up up

of of

. 

In In
part part
, ,
this thi
change change
may may
be be
caused caused
by by
GP GP

mediated mediated
modulations modulation
of of
the the
TSST TSST

Accordingly Accordingly
, ,
we we
found found
that that

of of
NFkappaB NFkappaB

Of Of
the the
four four
examined examined
NFkappaB NFkappaB
sites site
from from
the the
IL IL

1RA 1RA
promoter promoter
, ,
mostly mostly
the the
TSST TSST
- -
1 1
- -
and and
LPS LPS
- -
induced induced
binding binding
to to
the the
NFkappaB3 NFkappaB3
and and
the the
TSST TSST
- -
1 1

induced induced
binding binding
to to
the the
new new
NFkappaB NFkappaB
consensus consensu
site site
seemed seemed
to to
be be
increased increased
by by
GP GP
. 

So So
, ,
while while
we we
observed observed
a a
GP GP

mediated mediated
down down

regulation regulation
of of
the the
LPS LPS

and and
the the
TSST TSST

1 1

induced induced
NFkappaB NFkappaB
binding binding
to to
sites site
of of
the the
TNFalpha TNFalpha
promoter promoter
, ,
there there
was was
an an
up up

regulation regulation

NFkappaB3 NFkappaB3
and and
NFkappaB NFkappaB
consensus consensu
sites site
of of
the the
IL IL

1RA 1RA
promoter promoter
. 

These These
seemingly seemingly
contradictory contradictory
data data
could could
be be
explained explained
by by
differences difference
in in
either either
NFkappaB NFkappaB
subunits subunit
or or
conserved conserved
nucleotides nucleotide
(# (#

within within

between between
the the

probably probably
leading leading
to to
differences difference
in in
binding binding
[ [

Despite Despite
the the

Our Our

The The

gene gene
is is
an an
immediate immediate

in in
that that
it it
is is

Here Here

we we
demonstrate demonstrate
that that
the the

Thus Thu

although although
the the

suggests suggest
that that
this thi
factor factor

Complications Complication
after after

include include
the the
development development
of of
rejection rejection
and and
an an
increased increased
incidence incidence
of of
infection infection
, ,
particularly particularly
with with
cytomegalovirus cytomegaloviru
( (
CMV CMV
). ).
Several Several
recent recent
studies studie
have have
suggested suggested
that that
interleukin interleukin
( (
IL IL
)- )-
6 6
may may
be be
used used
to to
detect detect
both both
infection infection
and and
rejection rejection
after after

. 

In In
addition addition
, ,
IL IL

6 6
may may
play play
a a
role role
in in
the the
development development
of of
bronchiolitis bronchioliti
obliterans obliteran
after after

. 

Because Because
CMV CMV
is is
also also
associated associated
with with
the the
development development
of of
bronchiolitis bronchioliti
obliterans obliteran
after after
transplantation transplantation
, ,
we we
determined determined
whether whether
CMV CMV
induces induce
IL IL

. 

We We
demonstrated demonstrated
that that
CMV CMV
infection infection
increased increased
both both
IL IL

6 6
protein protein
and and
mRNA mRNA
in in
peripheral peripheral
blood blood
mononuclear mononuclear
cells cell
. 

We We
also also
demonstrated demonstrated
that that
the the
CMV CMV
immediate immediate
early early
1 1
gene gene
product product
increased increased
expression expression
of of
the the
IL IL

6 6
promoter promoter
. 

This Thi
effect effect
of of
the the

was was
dependent dependent
upon upon
the the
presence presence
of of

These These
studies studie
demonstrate demonstrate
that that
CMV CMV
may may
be be
an an
important important
cofactor cofactor
in in
the the
development development
of of
rejection rejection
and and

after after

a a
paradigm paradigm
for for
the the
haploinsufficiency haploinsufficiency
of of
mammalian mammalian

? ?
It It
is is
generally generally
assumed assumed
that that
most most
mammalian mammalian
genes gene
are are
transcribed transcribed
from from
both both
alleles allele
. 

Hence Hence
, ,
the the
diploid diploid
state state
of of
the the
genome genome
offers offer
the the
advantage advantage
that that
a a
loss los
- -
of of

function function
mutation mutation
in in
one one
allele allele
can can
be be
compensated compensated
for for
by by
the the
remaining remaining
wild wild
- -
type type
allele allele
of of
the the
same same
gene gene
. 

Indeed Indeed
, ,
the the
vast vast
majority majority
of of
human human
disease disease
syndromes syndrome
and and
engineered engineered
mutations mutation
in in
the the
mouse mouse
genome genome
are are
recessive recessive
, ,
indicating indicating
that that
recessiveness recessivenes
is is
the the
' '
default default
' '
state state
. 

However However
, ,
a a
minority minority
of of
genes gene
are are
semi semi
- -
dominant dominant
, ,
as as
heterozygous heterozygou
loss los

of of

function function
mutation mutation
in in
these these
genes gene
leads lead
to to
phenotypic phenotypic
abnormalities abnormalitie
. 

This Thi
condition condition
, ,
known known
as as
haploinsufficiency haploinsufficiency
, ,
has has
been been
described described
for for
five five
of of
the the
nine nine
mammalian mammalian
Pax Pax

, ,
which which
are are
associated associated
with with
mouse mouse
developmental developmental

and and
human human
disease disease

. 

Recently Recently
we we
have have
reported reported
that that
the the
Pax5 Pax5
gene gene
is is
subject subject
to to
allele allele
- -
specific specific
regulation regulation
during during
B B
cell cell
development development
. 

Pax5 Pax5
is is
predominantly predominantly
transcribed transcribed
from from
only only
one one
of of
its its
two two
alleles allele
in in
early early
B B
- -
lymphoid lymphoid
progenitors progenitor
and and
mature mature
B B
cells cell
, ,
while while
it it
transiently transiently
switches switche
to to
a a
biallelic biallelic
mode mode
of of
transcription transcription
in in
pre pre
- -
B B
and and
immature immature
B B
cells cell
. 

As As
a a
consequence consequence
, ,
B B
- -
lymphoid lymphoid
tissues tissue
are are
mosaic mosaic
with with
regard regard
to to
the the
transcribed transcribed
allele allele
, ,
and and
heterozygous heterozygou
mutation mutation
of of
Pax5 Pax5
therefore therefore
results result
in in
deletion deletion
of of
B B
lymphocytes lymphocyte
expressing expressing
only only
the the
mutant mutant
allele allele
. 

The The
allele allele
- -
specific specific

of of
Pax5 Pax5
raises raise
the the
intriguing intriguing
possibility possibility
that that
monoallelic monoallelic
expression expression
may may
also also
be be
the the
mechanism mechanism
causing causing
the the
haploinsufficiency haploinsufficiency
of of

In In

we we
discuss discus
different different
models model

for for
the the

In In

the the

This Thi

can can
be be
associated associated
with with
the the
activation activation
of of

, ,
since since
we we
observed observed

that that

. 

Together Together
, ,
these these
results result
demonstrate demonstrate
that that

can can
be be

The The
data data
presented presented

suggest suggest
that that

we we
have have
investigated investigated
the the

and and
found found
that that

we we
examined examined

Recent Recent

The The

However However

dispensable dispensable
for for

Increased Increased

may may
therefore therefore
be be
associated associated

be be
responsible responsible
for for

There There
is is
a a
possibility possibility
that that

may may
be be
associated associated
with with
the the
ability ability
of of

to to

because because

produce produce
high high

to to
indicate indicate
that that

Taking Taking

The The

the the

Unlike Unlike

Since Since
most most

mediated mediated

Discussion Discussion
In In
this thi
report report
, ,
we we
show show
that that
Sox6 Sox6
is is
a a
novel novel
factor factor
in in
the the
complicated complicated
regulation regulation
mechanism mechanism
of of
globin globin
genes gene
. 

In In
the the
Sox6 Sox6
null null
mouse mouse
, ,
there there
is is
a a
transient transient
effect effect
on on
the the
embryonic embryonic
globin globin
genes gene
, ,
zeta zeta
and and
betaH1 betaH1
, ,
and and
a a
persistent persistent
upregulation upregulation
of of
the the
epsilony epsilony
globin globin
gene gene
. 

Sox6 Sox6
directly directly
regulates regulate
and and
binds bind
to to
the the
proximal proximal
promoter promoter
of of
epsilony epsilony
gene gene
and and
represses represse
the the
epsilony epsilony
- -
globin globin
gene gene
in in
definitive definitive
erythropoiesis erythropoiesi
. 

Sox6 Sox6
belongs belong
to to
group group
D D
of of
the the
Sox Sox
family family
of of
proteins protein
that that
includes include
Sox5 Sox5
, ,
12 12
, ,
13 13
, ,
and and
23 23
[ [
34 34
]. ].
Group Group
D D
Sox Sox
proteins protein
contain contain
a a
coiled coiled
- -
coiled coiled
domain domain
that that
mediates mediate
homo homo
- -
and and
heterodimerization heterodimerization
[ [
6 6
, ,
35 35
]. ].
Functionally Functionally
, ,
dimerization dimerization
of of
Sox5 Sox5
and and
Sox6 Sox6
has has
been been
shown shown
to to
greatly greatly
increase increase
the the
binding binding
efficiency efficiency
of of
the the
two two
Sox Sox
proteins protein
to to
DNA DNA
that that
contains contain
adjacent adjacent
Sox Sox
sites site
[ [
6 6
]. ].
In In
addition addition
, ,
Sox6 Sox6
binds bind
more more
strongly strongly
to to
an an
HMG HMG
- -
box box
dimer dimer
motif motif
than than
to to
a a
single single
HMG HMG
- -
box box
motif motif
[ [
5 5
]. ].
Therefore Therefore
, ,
it it
appears appear
that that
target target
genes gene
for for
group group
D D
Sox Sox
proteins protein
, ,
such such
as as
Sox6 Sox6
, ,
probably probably
harbor harbor
pairs pair
of of
HMG HMG
binding binding
sites site
with with
a a
configuration configuration
compatible compatible
with with
binding binding
of of
D D
- -
Sox Sox
protein protein
dimers dimer
. 

Indeed Indeed
, ,
in in
the the
present present
study study
, ,
the the
defined defined
Sox6 Sox6
target target
sequence sequence
of of
the the
epsilony epsilony
promoter promoter
contains contain
two two
Sox Sox
/ /
Sox6 Sox6
consensus consensu
sites site
( (
Figure Figure

). ).
Functionally Functionally
, ,
both both
sites site
are are
essential essential
for for
Sox6 Sox6
binding binding
to to
the the
epsilony epsilony
promoter promoter

These These

suggest suggest
that that
Sox6 Sox6
binds bind
to to

either either
as as

A A

Sox6 Sox6

Therefore Therefore
, ,
one one
attractive attractive
model model
to to
explain explain

is is
that that
they they

By By
changing changing

Sox6 Sox6
could could
either either
interfere interfere

Another Another

Moreover Moreover

that that
the the

is is
due due

Taken Taken
together together
, ,
these these

demonstrate demonstrate
that that
Sox6 Sox6
functions function
in in

to to
silence silence

This Thi
demonstrates demonstrate
that that

is is
quite quite
robust robust
in in

The The

of of
two two
other other

are are
also also

However However

suggesting suggesting
that that

It It
is is
possible possible
that that

These These

suggest suggest
that that

Recently Recently
, ,
in in
vivo vivo
and and
in in

suggest suggest
that that
reactivation reactivation

would would
be be
therapeutically therapeutically
beneficial beneficial
to to
adults adult
with with
sickle sickle

[ [

providing providing
a a
rationale rationale
for for
detailed detailed
investigations investigation
into into
the the
molecular molecular

of of

. 

The The
present present
study study
identifies identifie
a a
novel novel

, ,
Sox6 Sox6
, ,
which which
binds bind
to to
the the
epsilony epsilony

potentially potentially
as as
part part
of of
a a

. 

Because Because

its its
human human
counterpart counterpart
are are
94 94
% %
identical identical
at at
the the
amino amino
acid acid

it it
is is
possible possible
that that
human human
Sox6 Sox6
may may
also also
be be
important important
in in
human human
epsilon epsilon

. 

There There
is is
significant significant
sequence sequence
homology homology
between between
the the
human human

, ,
and and
the the
human human

at at

two two

. 

Indeed Indeed
, ,
the the
existence existence
of of
a a

has has
been been
proposed proposed

Discussion Discussion
IL IL

17 17
was was
first first
described described
as as
a a
T T

product product
with with
proinflammatory proinflammatory
properties propertie
[ [

RA RA
is is
characterized characterized
by by
hyperplasia hyperplasia
of of
synovial synovial
lining lining
cells cell
and and
an an
intense intense
infiltration infiltration
by by
mononuclear mononuclear

Proinflammatory Proinflammatory
cytokines cytokine
such such
as as
IL IL

1 1
and and
TNF TNF

alpha alpha
are are
abundant abundant
in in
rheumatoid rheumatoid

, ,
whereas wherea
the the
T T

, ,
especially especially
IL IL

4 4
and and
interferon interferon

gamma gamma
, ,
have have
often often
proved proved
difficult difficult
to to
detect detect
in in
RA RA
synovium synovium
[ [

Although Although
T T
cells cell
may may
have have
a a
role role
in in
the the
augmentation augmentation
of of
rheumatoid rheumatoid
synovial synovial
inflammation inflammation
, ,
the the
lack lack
of of
T T

derived derived

has has
limited limited
its its
importance importance
. 

In In
this thi
respect respect
, ,
IL IL
- -
17 17
is is
appealing appealing
because because
it it
has has
been been
described described
as as
a a
T T
cell cell

derived derived
cytokine cytokine
with with
proinflammatory proinflammatory
properties propertie
. 

In In
our our
studies studie
, ,
we we
tried tried
to to
evaluate evaluate
how how
IL IL

17 17
production production
is is
regulated regulated
in in
RA RA
PBMC PBMC
, ,
and and
which which
signaling signaling
pathway pathway
it it
used used
. 

Levels Level
of of
IL IL

17 17
were were
found found
to to
be be
higher higher
in in
RA RA
synovial synovial
fluid fluid
than than
in in
OA OA
synovial synovial

[ [

However However
, ,
there there
are are
few few
data data
available available
on on
the the
agents agent
that that
stimulate stimulate
IL IL

in in
RA RA
, ,
although although
the the
highest highest
level level
of of
IL IL

17 17
production production
can can
be be
achieved achieved
by by

manner manner
. 

We We
found found
, ,
by by
a a
cell cell
proliferation proliferation
assay assay
( (
data data
not not
shown shown

that that
this thi
upregulation upregulation
of of
IL IL

17 17
might might
be be
due due
to to
increased increased
cellular cellular
activity activity
rather rather
than than
to to

. 

IL IL

17 17
is is
produced produced
mainly mainly

especially especially
for for

not not

However However

it it
can can
also also

A A

which which
also also
activate activate

For For

There There
are are
as as
yet yet
few few
data data
available available
on on
the the
agents agent
that that
stimulate stimulate

although although
some some

have have
been been
known known
to to
regulate regulate

We We
therefore therefore
investigated investigated
the the

Our Our
studies studie
demonstrated demonstrated
that that
IL IL

15 15
and and
MCP MCP

1 1
as as
well well
as as
TCR TCR
ligation ligation
significantly significantly
increased increased
the the
production production
of of

. 

Adding Adding
IL IL

15 15
or or
MCP MCP

1 1
to to
TCR TCR

augmented augmented

In In
contrast contrast

, ,
which which
are are
known known
to to
have have
proinflammatory proinflammatory

to to
be be
increased increased
in in

, ,
did did
not not
affect affect
IL IL

. 

Our Our
data data
were were
consistent consistent
with with
a a
recent recent
report report
that that

but but

so so
[ [

Although Although
there there
were were
no no
data data
that that
MCP MCP

directly directly
induces induce

it it
might might
exert exert

As As
reported reported
for for

also also
increases increase
IL IL

PBMC PBMC
. 

Although Although
the the
signaling signaling
pathway pathway
for for
the the
induction induction
of of
cytokines cytokine
/ /
chemokines chemokine
by by
IL IL

17 17
has has
been been
documented documented
widely widely
[ [
8 8

no no
data data
have have
been been
available available
on on
how how
IL IL

17 17
production production
can can
be be
regulated regulated
by by
certain certain
signaling signaling
pathways pathway
. 

By By
using using
signal signal
transduction transduction
inhibitors inhibitor
, ,
we we
therefore therefore
examined examined
which which
signaling signaling
pathway pathway
was was
mainly mainly
involved involved
in in
the the
induction induction
of of
IL IL

17 17
in in
RA RA
PBMC PBMC
. 

We We
identified identified
that that
anti anti

CD3 CD3
- -
induced induced
IL IL

17 17
production production
in in
RA RA
PBMC PBMC
was was
significantly significantly
hampered hampered
by by
the the
PI3K PI3K

LY294002 LY294002
and and
the the
NF NF

PDTC PDTC
to to
comparable comparable
levels level
of of
basal basal
production production
without without

. 

We We
also also
found found
that that
anti anti

CD3 CD3

induced induced
IL IL

17 17
production production
was was
downregulated downregulated
by by
the the
addition addition
of of
SB203580 SB203580
, ,
a a

. 

It It
is is
interesting interesting
that that
a a
series serie
of of
evidence evidence
supports support
crosstalk crosstalk
between between
NF NF

and and
p38 p38
. 

In In

is is
activated activated
by by

and and
the the

Our Our
results result
revealed revealed
that that
p38 p38

was was
not not
affected affected
by by
LY294002 LY294002
, ,
whereas wherea
NF NF

activity activity
was was
decreased decreased
by by
LY294002 LY294002
, ,
which which
provided provided
the the
evidence evidence
for for
a a
p38 p38
MAPK MAPK
pathway pathway
independent independent
of of
PI3K PI3K

. 

The The
direct direct
relationship relationship
between between
p38 p38
and and
NF NF

kappaB kappaB
for for
IL IL
- -
17 17
production production
needs need
to to
be be
studied studied
in in
future future
experiments experiment
. 

The The
search search
for for
a a
downstream downstream
pathway pathway
of of
PI3K PI3K
seemed seemed
to to
have have
a a
maximal maximal
response response
of of
Akt Akt
activation activation
at at
1 1
hour hour
and and
a a
gradual gradual
loss los
of of
activity activity
at at
2 2
hours hour
. 

The The
fact fact
that that
Akt Akt
is is
phosphorylated phosphorylated
upon upon
anti anti

CD3 CD3

suggests suggest
the the
possible possible
involvement involvement
of of
PI3K PI3K
in in
the the
induction induction
of of
IL IL
- -
17 17
in in
RA RA
. 

In In
view view
of of
the the
fact fact
that that
NF NF

kappaB kappaB
was was
also also
activated activated
by by
anti anti

CD3 CD3
/ /
anti anti

CD28 CD28
, ,
IL IL
- -
15 15
or or
mitogens mitogen
in in
our our

, ,
it it
is is
most most
likely likely
that that
the the
NF NF

kappaB kappaB
pathway pathway
is is
also also
actively actively
involved involved
in in
the the
induction induction
of of
IL IL

. 

In In
contrast contrast

another another
important important

, ,
was was
not not
activated activated
in in
our our

( (

Although Although
PI3K PI3K
and and
its its
downstream downstream
kinase kinase
Akt Akt
in in
association association
with with
NF NF

kappaB kappaB
have have
been been
reported reported
to to
deliver deliver

in in
many many
cell cell

, ,
the the
data data
on on
the the
signal signal
inducing inducing
IL IL

17 17
are are
lacking lacking
. 

Our Our
data data
clearly clearly
demonstrated demonstrated
that that
PI3K PI3K
/ /
Akt Akt
and and
resultant resultant
NF NF

could could
be be
an an
important important
arbitrator arbitrator
of of

on on
the the

of of

We We
investigated investigated

Both Both
methods method
demonstrated demonstrated
that that

is is
expressed expressed
in in

erythroblasts erythroblast
as as

In In

Because Because

We We
found found
that that

Remarkably Remarkably
, ,
the the

In In

In In

Although Although

In In

The The

This Thi
suggests suggest
that that

may may
play play

Furthermore Furthermore

these these

The The

whereas wherea
it it

In In

Interestingly Interestingly
, ,

These These

Regulation Regulation
of of

gene gene
by by
the the
alpha alpha
and and
beta beta
isoforms isoform
of of
the the
glucocorticoid glucocorticoid
receptor receptor
. 

The The
immunosuppressive immunosuppressive
effects effect
of of
glucocorticoids glucocorticoid
are are
largely largely
due due
to to
transcriptional transcriptional
inhibition inhibition
of of
immunologically immunologically
relevant relevant
genes gene
, ,
such such
as as
the the
interleukin interleukin

gene gene
. 

These These
effects effect
are are
mediated mediated
by by
the the
intracellular intracellular
glucocorticoid glucocorticoid
receptor receptor
( (
GR GR
). ).
In In
humans human
, ,
alternative alternative
splicing splicing
of of
the the
GR GR

gives give
rise rise
to to
two two
receptor receptor
isoforms isoform

termed termed
GRalpha GRalpha

The The

The The
aim aim
of of
this thi

was was
to to
investigate investigate
whether whether

account account
for for

varied varied
considerably considerably

assay assay
of of
the the
DNA DNA

and and
the the
steroid steroid

binding binding
region region
, ,
none none
of of
the the
treated treated
patients patient
revealed revealed
any any
mutation mutation

suggesting suggesting
that that
the the
glucocorticoid glucocorticoid

in in
the the
CLL CLL
patients patient
tested tested
is is
not not
altered altered
in in
these these
domains domain
. 

In In
one one

had had
not not
been been
treated treated
before before
analysis analysi
a a
silent silent

was was
found found
in in

The The
results result
suggest suggest
that that
mechanisms mechanism
other other
than than
altered altered
ligand ligand
or or
DNA DNA
binding binding
of of
the the

may may
be be
responsible responsible
for for
